# MVVM-UIRenderer
Developed base on concept of data encapsulation, reusability, clean and well structuring of programming, Data Binding Framework and handling the User interface in better way. It allows for “binding” of views to fields on an arbitrary object. When a field is updated, the framework is notified and the view is updated automatically. It also easy for testing purpose.

It implemented the following UI layer pattern
* MVVM sample
* RecyclerView, ListView and GridView implementaion using view builder and renderer.
